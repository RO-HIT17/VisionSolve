[SYNC: 0] Welcome to a journey unveiling the universe's most famous equation: E=mc². This equation reveals the profound equivalence of energy and mass, showing how a small amount of mass holds tremendous energy. [SYNC: 10] Let's break down the terms. E represents energy, measured in Joules. And m stands for mass, measured in kilograms, while c is the speed of light. [SYNC: 25] Consider a tiny amount of matter, just one gram. Converting this mass entirely into energy yields an astonishing amount, demonstrating the immense power locked within matter. [SYNC: 40] E=mc² has profound implications. It underpins nuclear energy, explains stellar energy generation, and provides insight into the fundamental nature of matter and energy. Understanding this equation unlocks a deeper comprehension of our universe.
