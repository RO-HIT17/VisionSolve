[SYNC: 0] Welcome! Today we're diving into the fascinating world of photosynthesis. This process allows plants to convert light energy into the chemical energy that fuels life. [SYNC: 8] Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water, along with light energy, to create glucose and oxygen. Understanding this equation is crucial to understanding how plants sustain themselves and produce the air we breathe. [SYNC: 26] Within plant cells, photosynthesis occurs inside chloroplasts. Key structures include the stroma, grana, and thylakoid membranes, each playing a vital role in the process. [SYNC: 42] The process can be divided into two stages: light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. These reactions work together to capture light energy and convert carbon dioxide into glucose. [SYNC: 58] Photosynthesis is a fundamental process that sustains ecosystems. By understanding the mechanisms of photosynthesis, we can better appreciate the interconnectedness of life on Earth.
