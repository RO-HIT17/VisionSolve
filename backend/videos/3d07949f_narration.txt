[SYNC: 0] Photosynthesis is the amazing process plants use to transform light energy into the chemical energy that fuels life. This energy is stored in sugars, created from carbon dioxide and water. [SYNC: 12] The chemical equation for photosynthesis shows how six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water, with the help of light and chlorophyll, produce one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen. These are the essential ingredients and products of the process. [SYNC: 27] Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages. First, light-dependent reactions capture light energy. Then, the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin Cycle, use that energy to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. [SYNC: 42] Through photosynthesis, plants provide the foundation for most food chains and release the oxygen we breathe, making it a cornerstone of life on Earth.
