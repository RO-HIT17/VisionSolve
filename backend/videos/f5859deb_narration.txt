[SYNC: 0] Photosynthesis! It's how plants transform light energy into the chemical energy that fuels life. We'll explore this vital process and how it converts light into sugars. [SYNC: 13] Let's look at the overall equation: Carbon dioxide, water, and light energy combine to produce glucose and oxygen. These products are essential for both plants and animals. [SYNC: 30] Inside the Chloroplast, where photosynthesis happens, we find the thylakoids and stroma. The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoids. [SYNC: 56] The light-dependent reactions capture energy, producing ATP and NADPH. Then, in the Calvin cycle, these products are used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. [SYNC: 88] Photosynthesis is the foundation of most food chains, converting sunlight into usable energy. Understanding this process is key to understanding life on Earth.
