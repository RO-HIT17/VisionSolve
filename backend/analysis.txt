Problem is not with Azure Deployment - cnfrmed

Complexites:
4 min Timout
Error in Video Genration
Docker Image too large - 27GB
Pycario dependies are installing in the container in render - worked in Azure
Docker Build Takes 15-20mns
Generated Video came out to be less than 20sec - Problem with code
Flask PORT and Process issues - fixed
Videos arent stored

Step 1 - 
Setup Github Repo
Make it work Locally
Run it with the help of Docker
Make sure it runs perfectly with Docker in local

Modify App.py slightly
Setup PORT and GEMINI in Azure



Action Plan 
Redo from start
Use updated Video generation code 
Fix this in backend
Make the backend complete production ready

Done Start


Found New Bug -> 


OLD CODE STILL GENERATES DECENT VIDEO BUT IN DOCKER SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THE VIDEO IS TRIMMED

If only python code works test it by only creating a container for it


Azure Port number changes - temporarily hardcoding in env variables

2 Main Bugs:
Azure PORT Shouldnt be hardcoded
If hardcoded it works only once
Then the 6 sec video is due to the previous and temp/ cached files

Docker Crashing

Docker Video - Fixable
4min Timeout
Azure PORT Error - Random
Frontend Change
Frontend + New Video Generation  + Docker Integration

ok idea to overcome 4min timeout 
return a fake 200 Response
then render video once its done
